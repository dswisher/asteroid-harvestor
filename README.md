# Asteroid Harvestor

This is my reinterpretation of the class Asteroids game, written in Godot.


# Bugs

* The background CanvasRect needs to handle other screen sizes, and needs to resize (try web export)
* Need to handle screen resize


# Web Export

To export to web:

* Select "Project -> Export...", select the "Web" preset on the left, then click "Export Project..."
* Create the `exports` directory, if it does not exist
* Make sure the file name is `index.html` and click "Save"

To test locally, open a terminal window, go to the `exports` directory, and run:

    python -m http.server

Browse to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
